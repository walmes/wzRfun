This package contains functions that were developed over time for
analysis and representation of data in addition to other general-purpose
tasks. The package name has a very obvious composition except for the
fact that I prefer to think about Rfun as *R is fun* and not R
*functions to R*.

## Instalation

You can install this package from GitHub runnig the code below in a R session.

```{r}
